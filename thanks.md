# Thanks for 3.0

We finally made the 3.0 release ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠ . Which is also the first real production-ready release with stable API of zio-http.
I am very happy to have reached this milestone.

Thanks to all the contributors and users of ZIO HTTP!
Especially thanks to:
- @jdegoes for his vision, code contribution, mentoring and sponsoring of the project.
- @vigoo for a lot of code contribution at the beginning of the 3.x series.
- @kyri-petrou for optimizations and bug fixes.
- @khajavi for his work on the documentation.

I hope you will enjoy working with zio-http as much as I do working with it and developing it.

Best regards,<br>
Nabil Abdel-Hafeez aka @987nabil ðŸ¥³
