# Request Handling

Request handling in ZIO HTTP involves extracting data from incoming HTTP requests and generating appropriate responses. This process is essential for building robust and scalable HTTP applications.

## Key Concepts of Request Handling:

**The** HttpRequest **object** encapsulates all information about the incoming request, including:

- **Method**: The HTTP method used (GET, POST, PUT, etc.).
- **Path**: The requested URL path.
- **Headers**: Key-value pairs containing additional information from the client.
- **Body**: The request body containing data sent from the client (if applicable).

### Extracting Data from Requests

- ZIO HTTP provides utilities to extract various parts of an HTTP request:
  - **Path Parameters**: Extract dynamic segments from the URL path.
  - **Query Parameters**: Retrieve values from the query string.
  - **Headers**: Access HTTP headers for additional metadata.
  - **Request Body**: Read and parse the request body, which can be in different formats such as JSON, XML, or plain text.

### Generating Responses

- After processing the request, generate a response using ZIO HTTP's response utilities:
  - **Status Codes**: Set the appropriate HTTP status code (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).
  - **Response Body**: Include the response body, which can be in various formats such as JSON, XML, or plain text.
  - **Headers**: Add HTTP headers to the response for additional metadata.
