# Tutorial: Your First ZIO HTTP App

## Introduction

ZIO is a modern, high-performance library for asynchronous programming in Scala. It provides a powerful and expressive API for building scalable and reliable applications. ZIO also has a strong focus on type safety and resource management, which makes it a popular choice for building server-side applications.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to build your first ZIO HTTP application. We will start by setting up a basic ZIO project and then create an HTTP server using the ZIO HTTP module. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a working ZIO HTTP application.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- JDK 11 or greater
- SBT (Scala Build Tool)

## Setup

To get started, we need to set up a new SBT project. Here are the steps following the same:


1. Create a new directory for your project.
2. Inside the project directory, create a new file named `build.sbt`.
3. Open the `build.sbt` file and add the following lines:

```scala

scalaVersion := "2.13.8"

libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "dev.zio" %% "zio" % "2.0.14",
  "dev.zio" %% "zio-streams" % "2.0.14",
  "dev.zio" %% "zio-interop-cats" % "2.5.1.0",
  "dev.zio" %% "zio-logging" % "0.5.12",
  "dev.zio" %% "zio-logging-slf4j" % "0.5.12",
  "org.http4s" %% "http4s-blaze-server" % "1.0.0-M23",
  "org.http4s" %% "http4s-dsl" % "1.0.0-M23"
)
```
4. Save the file.

## Building the HTTP Server

-  Create a new file named `Main.scala` in the project's root directory.

- Open `Main.scala` and add the following code:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import zio._

import zio.console._
import org.http4s._
import org.http4s.dsl.Http4sDsl
import org.http4s.blaze.server.BlazeServerBuilder
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.global

object Main extends App {
  val dsl = Http4sDsl[Task]
  import dsl._
  val appLogic: HttpRoutes[Task] = HttpRoutes.of[Task] {
    case GET -> Root / "hello" =>
      Ok("Hello, ZIO HTTP!")
  }
  val server: ZIO[ZEnv, Throwable, Unit] =
    ZIO.runtime[ZEnv].flatMap { implicit rts =>
      BlazeServerBuilder[Task](global)
        .bindHttp(8080, "0.0.0.0")
        .withHttpApp(appLogic.orNotFound)
        .serve
        .compile
        .drain
    }
  def run(args: List[String]): URIO[ZEnv, ExitCode] =
    server.provideCustomLayer(Console.live).exitCode
}
```
- Save the file.

## Running the HTTP Server

To run the HTTP server, open your terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.

Run the following command:

```
sbt run
```
Wait for the server to start. You should see a message indicating that the server is running on http://0.0.0.0:8080.

## Testing the HTTP Server

To test the HTTP server, open your web browser or use a tool like cURL or Postman.

Open your browser and visit http://localhost:8080/hello.

You should see the response `Hello, ZIO HTTP!`.

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ You have successfully built your first ZIO HTTP application! ðŸš€
